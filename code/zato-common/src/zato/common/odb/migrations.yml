# Special entry containing migration steps for a brand new install. Used
# internally by create_cluster.py only during initial ODB creation. It is not
# possible to share these step files with other migrations, because then they
# could never be changed. Instead e.g. a feature branch introducing a new set
# of ODB objects should have one script in migrations/initial/ and one for its
# Git commit.
